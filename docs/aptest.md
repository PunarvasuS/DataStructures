# Test Corrections

## Study Plan
Do tests, do corrections, study over weekend for Week 6 practice tests

## Study Reflection
I did pretty good on the tests (45/50 & 47/50). I studied a little, but not much, so I think these are good scores. I will study all three tests before the real AP test, so I can absolutely guarantee a 90%< score.

## Practice Quiz #1 (47/50):
### Q1
![Q1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89180494/164954279-d813789f-ae79-4a79-af55-23039293e2f0.png)
I misread the question, and thought it asked 'MOST likely', so I picked the 'memory' answer instead of the 'statements' answer.

### Q37

I don't know why this one is wrong, there is no explanation on how D proves the statement doesn't work.

### Q45

The explanation for this question is weird. I don't know how 'people and society' includes election results, but I now realize that you cannot view the price of a product when you only have the amount of times it's been searched.

## Practice Quiz #2 (45/50):
### Q1

I was hovering between 'infinitely splittable' and 'limited splitting', and I happened to choose the wrong one.

### Q24

"Redundancy on the Internet allows packets to be transmitted along multiple paths, but does not reduce the number of packets needed to transmit a particular message."
Redundancy is, as far as I know, fault tolerance. Connections through different paths of the Internet mean that the packets have a higher likelihood of reaching the end user.

### Q30

I think I misclicked here, because convertign binary o decimal isnt that hard, I shouldn't have messed that up so badly (neither of the #s match up)

### Q33

I thought the title would be necessary for organization reasons, but I guess not...

### Q41

IDK why I picked this one, it logically just does not make sense. You should count the # of transcations/payments, not the # of total items purchased.
