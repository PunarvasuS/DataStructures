## 3/14/22 5.3 - 5.4 Notes

### 5.3

#### Video 1

- Explicit Data
-   data you directly give
- Implicit Data 
-   data collected from streams (not intentionally given)
-   innovations can show human biases from hard-coded bias, or in dataset
-   computing innovations can reflect human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or in data used by innovation
-   programmers should combat human bias by reducing algorithmical bias
-   Biases can be at all levels of software development
-   All software can be biased (unintentional or intentional)
- important questions to ask about bias
-   enhancing or intentionally excluding?
-   intentionally harmful/hateful?
-   receiving feedback from a wide variety of people? 

#### TPS Questions



### 5.4

#### Video 1

- Public Data Sets
- Kaggle
  - courses in visualization, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning and more competitions
  - Notebooks - code, data, notes
- Google Public Datasets
  - Free for 1st terabyte
  - all in one package; uses BigQuery
- Data.gov
  - US government data
- distributed computing can be crowd sourced, too:
  - AlphaFold
  - Folding@Home
   - i actually used this program a while back, not for long though
  - BOINC
  - Innovations made possible by crowdsourcing
  - Spotify
  - Blockchain

## 3/7/22 5.1 - 5.2 Notes

### 5.1 

#### Video 1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Technology

- Accelerometers
  - automobile industry drove price down
  - airbag deployment & lateral movement detection
  - completion of tasks change to incorporate new innovations

Pros and Cons of Innovation
- Multirotor drone
  - Pros
        - delivery, finding lost people, easy aerial photography
  - Cons
        - privacy concerns, flying in unregulated zones
  - Wii Controller
        - Benefit - gets people active playing video games
        - Harmful - Broken TV's and injuries

- Not all effects of a computing innovation are anticipated
- same effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful
- 3D Printers
  - Open-source software for computer and printer
  - In schools and homes
- People create computing innovations
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields
- Everything has beneficial and harmful effects.

#### Video 2: The Internet

- Benefit - dopamine feedback loops
- Harmful - dopamine feedback loops, sleep deprivation, anxiety, impulsivity
- Computing innovations can be used in unintentional ways
- Responsible programmers should consider unintended ways/usages
- impossible to consider all ways/usages
- Rapid sharing or too many users could have significant impacts beyond intended purpose(s) or control of the programmer.

#### TPS Questions

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
 - Beneficial
   - Free access to information (the Internet)
   - High density storage of data
   - Multitasking
 - Harmful
   - Easier spread of misinformation
   - Fragility of data (viruses & malware)
   - Over/hyper stimulation

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Addictions to non-physical items are real. Although there is no physical substance abuse happening, dopamine feedback loops  still exist within gaming and video games.
A great example of this is gambling, like in casinos. Players are not ingesting anything, but they still get addicted to winning and losing money in these games. 
For me personally, I don't think I have a problem. I do occasionally play when I'm not supposed to, but I never get "withdrawals" from not playing.

### 5.2

#### Video 1: The Digital Divide

- differing access to computing devices & Internet based on socioecon, geographic, demographic characteristics
- Socioeconomic - how muchwaa3aad a  da dada1wdadWmoney comes into the household per year
- Do you have enough disposable income to get devices? Can you pay for high-speed internet? 
- Geographic - depending on where you are, there may be more internet access or less 
- Demographics include but not isolated to age or religion and more. 
- In some countries
  - computers not common in rural
  - handful of websites
  - Internet used to protect and advocate the government
  - Internet surveillance to protect the government

The Digital Divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.

#### TPS Questions

How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?

- Get online, "surf" the Internet. In order to reach your digital potential, you need to seek out improvements. 

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- Hand them a phone, laptop, or any device, give them some pointers, and set them free. I could (theoretically) give away such devices, but the school is already doing that for us. 

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

- Paper/red tape does block digital empowerment. Specifically at Del Norte (& PUSD at large), the school Wi-Fi blocks many websites.
The school Chromebooks even block some Chrome extensions, like foreign language accent extensions.
I ran into this problem in Spanish, where I physically could not answer some questions because of this restriction.
