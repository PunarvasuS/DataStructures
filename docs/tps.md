MIT License
- Allows user to edit the software, use it for commercial use, and to distribute it to other people. However, if you were to use this license that means that the creator of the code is not responsible for fixing the code if you break it and is not responsible for any harm that the code may cause.

GPL
- Allows many of the same permissions as the MIT license but they also allow patent use. That means that the all contributors must express patent rights. In addition to this additional requirement, there are some additional conditions that are applied. Some of these conditions are that the source code must be made available when the licensed material is distributed, modifications to the software must be recorded and that the same license must apply to the modifications as the original code.

Mozilla Public License
- This does very similar things to the GPL licenses but there are some slight but very major changes. The Mozilla Public License states that modification to existing files must have the same license. This means that if the licensed work is being used in a larger piece of work, the source code doesn't have to be distributed and the terms can be changed. There is also an additional limitation to this license. That is the trademark license that states that it does not grant trademark rights.

- age
- race
- phone #
- SSN
- DoB
- email
- mailing address
- medical info
- credit card info
- identity & $$$ theft, impersonation
- Pros - enhance a user's online experience 
- Cons - exploited if privacy and other protections are ignored

#### Video 2: Authentication

- protect devices and info from unauthorized access 
- Measures 
  - strong passwords 
  
  - 10<= characters 
  - must contain 
  - symbol 
  - number 
  - lower & uppercase letters 
        - Multi-Factor Authentication
          - Types of authentication 
            - What you know 
            - What you have 
            - What you are 
- Virus and Malware 
  - malicious programs that ttry to access things they aren't supposed to
  - often intended to damage computing system or take control 
  - either pose as legitimate program or attached with legitimate program 
- Encryption - encoding data to prevent unauthorized access 
- Decryption - the process of decoding data
- 2 Types of Encryption 
  - Symmetric Encryption 
        - uses one key to both encrypt and decrypt
  - Asymmetric Encryption
        - Public Key encryption - uses two keys
          - a public key for encrypting
          - a private key for decrypting 
        - Sender does not need the receiver's private key to decrypt 
        - the receiver's private key IS required to decrypt the message

#### Video 3: Risks to Personal Safety 

- Phishing - attempt to trick the user into providing personal info 
- Phishing Emails 
  - often look like they're from a company you trust 
  - trick you into clicking a link or opening an attachment 
  - clicking a link or opening an attachment in a phishing email will cause unexpected harm 
  - virus installed on your computer 
  - spoofed banking website 
  - Keylogger
        - records every keystroke to gain fraudulent access to passwords or other confidential info
- Rogue Access Point 
- a wireless network that can give unauthorized access to secure networks 

#### TPS Questions

1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
- PII that I have seen on projects in CompSci Principles are in the AboutMe pages put in the websites.
- These about me pages usually had information about us as a person.
- It could have pictures of us and our names.
- Some people put their email adresses or maybe their birthdate.
- Nothing too serious was put in projects for CompSci Principles which is good.
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure? 
- I feel that there are some PII which is okay to expose to te public and the world and some PII must be kept personal at almost all costs.
- I think that everyone has PII and that it is important to keep what need's to be safe, safe.
- For example, stuff like your name. your birthdate, what school you got to and what you may look like are all information that is almost completely public.
- Other information such as your social security number, your tax records, and maybe credentials or two-factor credentials
are absolutely necessary to keep silent because if this information is leaked out, you can get your identity stolen.
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
- Good passwords are passwords that are long, convoluted, and have a mixture of characters, letters and numbers to make it hard to guess.
- Bad passwords are easy to guess and can easily be bruteforced which makes the system very very unsafe. Usually good passwords are at least 8 letters long, has both lowercase and uppercase letters, characters, and numbers. Another step that is used to assist in authentication is two-factor authentication. That means that there are actually two keys that are needed to authenticate something such as a password and a biometric scan. Maybe there are two different passwords that must be used.
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
- Symmetric encryption is where one key is used to both encrypt the information and decrypt the information.
- This means that this key must be kept very safe or else it can used for both encrypting and decrypting.
- An asymmetric encryption is an encryption where there are two keys that are used for decrypting and encrypting.
- A public key is used for encrypting the information while a private key is used for decrypting the information.
5. Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
- An example of encryption we used in deployment is on the software to update the deployed website.
- The software that is being used to update the deployed website requires a password to enter.
- That means that there is encryption since a password is being used to protect data.
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
- I have never actually fell for a phishing scheme.
- I've never had my information stolen or anything like that which I feel very lucky about.
- Although I have never learned about phishing schemes the hard way, I understand what they can look like and what they so I can avoid falling for them.I know that generally phishing attempts will include asking for very personal information generally through an email.
- The phishing attempt might claim to be the bank or something that is really important in order to try to trick you into clicking and giving the information needed.

### 5.3

#### Video 1: Data

- Explicit Data
  - data you directly give
- Implicit Data 
  - data collected from streams (not intentionally given)
  - innovations can show human biases from hard-coded bias, or in dataset
  - computing innovations can reflect human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or in data used by innovation
  - programmers should combat human bias by reducing algorithmical bias
  - Biases can be at all levels of software development
  - All software can be biased (unintentional or intentional)
  - important questions to ask about bias
  - enhancing or intentionally excluding?
  - intentionally harmful/hateful?
  - receiving feedback from a wide variety of people? 

#### TPS Questions: [HP Computers Are Racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)

Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
- Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
  - No, he does not think it's intentional
- If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
  - He's laughing and thinks it's funny, the title is just to grab attention.
- How do you think this happened?
  - The creaters of the HP computer were all probably white, meaning they tuned the camera to white faces; the training data was biased
- Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
  - This is harmful, as it excludes black users from using the camera focusing feature. It was (probably) not intented, as this video was uploaded to YouTube in 2009, where we were quite progressive.
- Should it be corrected?
  - Yes, it should be corrected. 
- What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
  - Include black people from all over the world in the training data to make sure that the camera also focuses on them.

### 5.4

#### Video 1: Public Data Sets

- Kaggle
  - courses in visualization, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning and more competitions
  - Notebooks - code, data, notes
- Google Public Datasets
  - Free for 1st terabyte
  - all in one package; uses BigQuery
- Data.gov
  - US government data
- distributed computing can be crowd sourced, too:
  - AlphaFold
  - Folding@Home
   - i actually used this program a while back, not for long though (too resource-intensive)
  - BOINC
  - Innovations made possible by crowdsourcing
  - Spotify
  - Blockchain
  - Crowdfunding 

#### TPS Questions: Crowdsourcing

CS P has 150 students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
- Our idea for our website could very well use crowdsourcing. We're planning on having a site that has movie reviews.
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
- We could colelct movie revies from Del Norte students, and then include the average of those reviews as one of our reviews on the site.
## 3/7/22 5.1 - 5.2 Notes

### 5.1 

#### Video 1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Technology

- Accelerometers
  - automobile industry drove price down
  - airbag deployment & lateral movement detection
  - completion of tasks change to incorporate new innovations

Pros and Cons of Innovation
- Multirotor drone
  - Pros
        - delivery, finding lost people, easy aerial photography
  - Cons
        - privacy concerns, flying in unregulated zones
  - Wii Controller
        - Benefit - gets people active playing video games
        - Harmful - Broken TV's and injuries

- Not all effects of a computing innovation are anticipated
- same effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful
- 3D Printers
  - Open-source software for computer and printer
  - In schools and homes
- People create computing innovations
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields
- Everything has beneficial and harmful effects.

#### Video 2: The Internet

- Benefit - dopamine feedback loops
- Harmful - dopamine feedback loops, sleep deprivation, anxiety, impulsivity
- Computing innovations can be used in unintentional ways
- Responsible programmers should consider unintended ways/usages
- impossible to consider all ways/usages
- Rapid sharing or too many users could have significant impacts beyond intended purpose(s) or control of the programmer.

#### TPS Questions

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
 - Beneficial
   - Free access to information (the Internet)
   - High density storage of data
   - Multitasking
 - Harmful
   - Easier spread of misinformation
   - Fragility of data (viruses & malware)
   - Over/hyper stimulation

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Addictions to non-physical items are real. Although there is no physical substance abuse happening, dopamine feedback loops  still exist within gaming and video games.
A great example of this is gambling, like in casinos. Players are not ingesting anything, but they still get addicted to winning and losing money in these games. 
For me personally, I don't think I have a problem. I do occasionally play when I'm not supposed to, but I never get "withdrawals" from not playing.

### 5.2

#### Video 1: The Digital Divide

- differing access to computing devices & Internet based on socioecon, geographic, demographic characteristics
- Socioeconomic - how muchwaa3aad a  da dada1wdadWmoney comes into the household per year
- Do you have enough disposable income to get devices? Can you pay for high-speed internet? 
- Geographic - depending on where you are, there may be more internet access or less 
- Demographics include but not isolated to age or religion and more. 
- In some countries
  - computers not common in rural
  - handful of websites
  - Internet used to protect and advocate the government
  - Internet surveillance to protect the government

The Digital Divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.

#### TPS Questions

How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?

- Get online, "surf" the Internet. In order to reach your digital potential, you need to seek out improvements. 

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- Hand them a phone, laptop, or any device, give them some pointers, and set them free. I could (theoretically) give away such devices, but the school is already doing that for us. 

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

- Paper/red tape does block digital empowerment. Specifically at Del Norte (& PUSD at large), the school Wi-Fi blocks many websites.
The school Chromebooks even block some Chrome extensions, like foreign language accent extensions.
I ran into this problem in Spanish, where I physically could not answer some questions because of this restriction.
