#### TPS Questions

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
 - Beneficial
   - Free access to information (the Internet)
   - High density storage of data
   - Multitasking
 - Harmful
   - Easier spread of misinformation
   - Fragility of data (viruses & malware)
   - Over/hyper stimulation

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

Addictions to non-physical items are real. Although there is no physical substance abuse happening, dopamine feedback loops  still exist within gaming and video games.
A great example of this is gambling, like in casinos. Players are not ingesting anything, but they still get addicted to winning and losing money in these games. 
For me personally, I don't think I have a problem. I do occasionally play when I'm not supposed to, but I never get "withdrawals" from not playing.

### 5.2

#### Video 1: The Digital Divide

- differing access to computing devices & Internet based on socioecon, geographic, demographic characteristics
- Socioeconomic - how muchwaa3aad a  da dada1wdadWmoney comes into the household per year
- Do you have enough disposable income to get devices? Can you pay for high-speed internet? 
- Geographic - depending on where you are, there may be more internet access or less 
- Demographics include but not isolated to age or religion and more. 
- In some countries
  - computers not common in rural
  - handful of websites
  - Internet used to protect and advocate the government
  - Internet surveillance to protect the government

The Digital Divide raises issues of equity, access, and influence, both globally and locally.

#### TPS Questions

How does someone empower themselves in a digital world?

- Get online, "surf" the Internet. In order to reach your digital potential, you need to seek out improvements. 

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

- Hand them a phone, laptop, or any device, give them some pointers, and set them free. I could (theoretically) give away such devices, but the school is already doing that for us. 

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

- Paper/red tape does block digital empowerment. Specifically at Del Norte (& PUSD at large), the school Wi-Fi blocks many websites.
The school Chromebooks even block some Chrome extensions, like foreign language accent extensions.
I ran into this problem in Spanish, where I physically could not answer some questions because of this restriction.
